### Introduction 
This Google data analytics capstone project is the final piece that seeks to test your ability as a data analyst using the phases of data analysis**(Ask,Prepare,Process,Analyze,Share **and **Act)** taught in the course. 

The case study focus on cyclistic bike-share program featuring 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. They have 3 flexible plans which includes:**Single ride pass**, **Full-day passes** and **Annual memberships**. 

As a Junior data Analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, I'm expected to conduct an analysis and bring recommendations that will help in converting casual riders to annual members.



### Phase 1: Ask
This involves identifying the business tasks, asking the right questions and considering the stakeholders involved.

#### The business task involves 
Analyzing the different ways members and casual riders use bikes differently

#### Asking the right questions 
Questions that will guide the future marketing program:

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

#### Key Stakeholders involved
1. The director of marketing and my manager **Lily Moreno** responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program through emails, social media or other channels.

2. **The Cyclistic executive team** that will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.


### Phase 2: Prepare
* Data was gotten from [Divvy bikes](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) 
* This data includes 12 months file in .csv format from **June 2021 to May 2022**
* It is credible, free from bias and it is from a reliable source.
* It is an open source data.
* Data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [licence](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-licence-agreement). 

**Setting up my work environment and loading required R packages**

**Checking for similarities in column names**
```{r Checking for similarities in dataset}
glimpse(df_jun_2021)
glimpse(df_jul_2021)
glimpse(df_aug_2021)
glimpse(df_sep_2021)

```

*During inspection of column names, i discovered that some of my datasets had 2 of its columns(started_at and ended_at) had their format in "chr" instead of "datetime"(dttm). I will have to coovert those columns to "dttm" so as to maintain consistency*
```{r changing (started_at,ended_at) from "chr" to "dttm"}
df_jun_2021 <- mutate(df_jun_2021, started_at = as_datetime(started_at),
                      ended_at = as_datetime(ended_at))
df_jul_2021 <- mutate(df_jul_2021, started_at = as_datetime(started_at),
                      ended_at = as_datetime(ended_at))
df_aug_2021 <- mutate(df_aug_2021, started_at = as_datetime(started_at),
                      ended_at = as_datetime(ended_at))
df_sep_2021 <- mutate(df_sep_2021, started_at = as_datetime(started_at),
                      ended_at = as_datetime(ended_at))
df_oct_2021 <- mutate(df_oct_2021, started_at = as_datetime(started_at),
                      ended_at = as_datetime(ended_at))
df_nov_2021 <- mutate(df_nov_2021, started_at = as_datetime(started_at),
                      ended_at = as_datetime(ended_at))
df_dec_2021 <- mutate(df_dec_2021, started_at = as_datetime(started_at),
                      ended_at = as_datetime(ended_at))
df_jan_2022 <- mutate(df_jan_2022, started_at = as_datetime(started_at),
                      ended_at = as_datetime(ended_at))
df_feb_2022 <- mutate(df_feb_2022, started_at = as_datetime(started_at),
                      ended_at = as_datetime(ended_at))
df_mar_2022 <- mutate(df_mar_2022, started_at = as_datetime(started_at),
                      ended_at = as_datetime(ended_at))
df_apr_2022 <- mutate(df_apr_2022, started_at = as_datetime(started_at),
                      ended_at = as_datetime(ended_at))
df_may_2022 <- mutate(df_may_2022, started_at = as_datetime(started_at),
                      ended_at = as_datetime(ended_at))
```

**Combining the 12 months datasets into one dataframe**
```{r joining the rows together}
all_rides <- bind_rows(df_jun_2021, df_jul_2021, df_aug_2021,
                               df_sep_2021, df_oct_2021, df_nov_2021,
                               df_dec_2021, df_jan_2022, df_feb_2022,
                               df_mar_2022, df_apr_2022, df_may_2022)
```

**Checking the new dataset**
```{r inspecting the dataset}
colnames(all_rides)
dim(all_rides)
nrow(all_rides)
str(all_rides)
summary(all_rides)
head(all_rides, 5)
skim_without_charts(all_rides)
```
**Observation**

* The dataset has 5860776 rows and 13 Columns
* There are two types of users: members and casual users

**Ability to address Business Task**

The data will be able to answer the business task by analyzing the different ways members and casual riders use bikes differently.

**Problems with the data**

* Some of the columns has missing value that might affect our overall analysis.
* Some of the columns needs to be renamed for easier understanding.



### Phase 3: Process
This is where we clean, manipulate and transform our data so as to prepare the data for analysis.

**Choice of tools for the analysis**
R Studio will be used for the analysis and visualization of the data because of the large dataset.

**Renaming columns for easier identification**
```{r renaming columns}
all_rides <- all_rides %>%
  rename(bike_type = rideable_type,
         membership_type = member_casual)
```

**Adding columns for ride_length**
```{r column for ride_length}
all_rides$ride_length <- difftime(all_rides$ended_at,
                                  all_rides$started_at)
```

**Adding columns for date, day, day_of_week, month and year**
```{r adding columns date, day, day_of_week, month, year and hour}
all_rides$date <- as.Date(all_rides$started_at)
all_rides$day <- format(as.Date(all_rides$date), "%d")
all_rides$day_of_week <- format(as.Date(all_rides$date), "%A")
all_rides$month <- format(as.Date(all_rides$date), "%m")
all_rides$year <- format(as.Date(all_rides$date), "%Y")
```

**Checking the dataframe**
```{r inspecting the dataframe}
skim_without_charts(all_rides)
```

**Observations**

* Minimum value of ride is -3482secs which makes it invalid.
* Maximum value of ride_length is 3356649secs(932.402hours)which makes it an outlier. 
* ride_length needs to be converted to numeric to perform calculations in it.

**Converting ride_length to numeric**
```{r converting ride_length to numeric}
all_rides$ride_length <- as.numeric(all_rides$ride_length)
```

**Removing Bad data**

* According to [Divvy data's website](https://ride.divvybikes.com/system-data), any ride_length below 60secs is potentially false starts or users trying to re-dock a bike so we have to remove it.
* We also have to remove ride_lengths above 24hours(86400secs)because they are outliers.
* Non-availaible(NA's)rides in end_lat and end_lng are considered invalid because it doesn't show where the rides ended.
```{r removing bad data for ride_length} 
all_rides2 <- all_rides %>%
        filter(!(ride_length<60)) %>%
        filter(!(ride_length>86400)) #removing bad data for ride_length
```
```{r replacing blank and space}
all_rides2$start_station_name[all_rides2$start_station_name == ""]<- NA #replacing empty cells in start station name with NA
```
```{r removing bad data for end_lat and end_lng}
all_rides2 <- all_rides2 %>%
  filter(!(is.na(end_lat)))%>%
  filter(!(is.na(end_lng))) #removing bad data for NA data in end_lat and end_lng
```

**Checking the new dataframe**
```{r inspecting the new dataframe}
skim_without_charts(all_rides2)
```

**Data Integrity**

The data has been cleaned, so its now accurate and complete as outliers and bad data has all been removed.

**Documenting the cleaning process**

The cleaning process has been documented using Rstudio and saved as an RMarkdown file.



### Phase 4: Analysis and Visualization of the data

**Descriptive analysis on ride_length**
```{r analysis on ride_length}
all_rides2 %>%
    summarise(mean = mean(ride_length), maximum = max(ride_length),
              minimum = min(ride_length), median = median(ride_length))
```
**Insights**

* The maximum ride length is 86391secs(24hrs).
* The minimum ride length is 60secs(1min).
* The average ride length is 1113.934secs(19mins).

**Descriptive analysis on ride_length and membership_type**
```{r analysis on ride_length and membership_type}
aggregate(all_rides2$ride_length ~ all_rides2$membership_type, FUN = mean)
aggregate(all_rides2$ride_length ~ all_rides2$membership_type, FUN = max)
aggregate(all_rides2$ride_length ~ all_rides2$membership_type, FUN = min)
```
**Insights**

* The average ride length is 1544secs(26mins)for casual riders  and 779secs(13mins)for member riders.
* The Maximum ride length is 86391secs(24hours) for casual riders and 86128secs(24hours) for member riders.
* The minimum ride length is 60secs(1min)for both casual and member riders

**Descriptive analysis on the total no. of rides**
```{r analysis on total no. of rides}
all_rides2 %>%
  group_by(membership_type)%>%
  summarise(number_of_rides = n())
```
**Insights**

* The total number of rides is *2481631* for casual riders and *3192283* for member riders.

**Descriptive analysis on the no. of rides for membership_type by day_of_week**
```{r mutate day_of_week}
all_rides2 <- all_rides2 %>%
  mutate(day_of_week = factor(day_of_week, levels = c("Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat")))
```
```{r analysis on ride_length on membership_type by day_of_week}
all_rides2 %>%
  group_by(membership_type, day_of_week)%>%
  summarise(number_of_ride = n()) %>%
  arrange(membership_type)
```

**Calculating the average ride_length by membership_type according to day_of_week** 
```{r average ride_length according to weekdays}
aggregate(all_rides2$ride_length ~ all_rides2$membership_type + all_rides2$day_of_week,
          FUN = mean)
```

**Calculating the total no.of rides by different membership_type according to months**
```{r mutate months in orderly manner }
all_rides2 <- all_rides2 %>%
  mutate(month = factor(month, levels = c("Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec", "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May")))
```
```{r total no. of rides}
all_rides2 %>%
  group_by(membership_type, month) %>%
  summarise(number_of_rides = n()) %>%
  arrange(membership_type)
```

**Getting the total no. of rides based on different bike_type**
```{r total no. of different bike_type}
table(all_rides2$bike_type)
```

**Getting the Top 5 starting stations for casual riders**
```{r}
all_rides2 %>%
  filter(!(is.na(start_station_name)))%>%
  filter(membership_type == "casual")%>%
  group_by(start_station_name)%>%
  summarise(number_of_rides = n())%>%
  arrange(-number_of_rides)%>%
  top_n(5)
```

**Getting the Top 5 starting stations for member riders**
```{r top 5 member starting stations}
all_rides2 %>%

### Phase 5: Share

* The Rmarkdown file where the data was cleaned and analyzed will be shared with analytical team.
* Lily Moreno will be presented with the result and findings from our analysis using Tableau's Dashboard.
* A presentation detailing both the conclusions and recommendations will be given to the executive team using     slides.

### Phase 6: Act

**Conclusions**

* The number of Member riders is higher than that of casual riders.

* Both Casual and member riders prefer making use of the classic bike.

* Member riders don't make use of the docked bikes.

* Casual riders have the most rides in the month of July while member riders have theirs in the month of September

* The casual riders have the most ride lengths when compared with that of the member riders.

* Casual riders ride lengths are highest during the weekends while member riders ride lengths are evenly distributed throughout the weekdays.

* Casual riders total no. of rides are highest during the weekends while member riders total no. of rides are significantly higher during the weekdays.

* The Top 5 starting station for the Casual riders is different from that of the member riders.


**Recommendations**

* Discount offers should be done during the weekends at the Top 5 starting stations of Casual riders.

* More Classic bikes should be provided at the starting stations of casual riders.

* Promotional activities with benefits of annual membership at a subsidized rate should be targeted at Casual riders during the months of June, July and August

* Since Casual riders make use of bikes on weekends the most, there could be a special weekend membership plan for them.
